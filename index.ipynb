    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lesson you were given a broad overview of logistic regression. This included an introduction to two separate packages for creating logistic regression models. In this lab, you'll be investigating fitting logistic regressions with `statsmodels`. For your first foray into logistic regression, you are going to attempt to build a model that classifies whether an individual survived the [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) shipwreck or not (yes, it's a bit morbid).\n",
